Hack-Router-Codegen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fredemmott/hack-router-codegen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fredemmott/hack-router-codegen)
===================

Code generation for controller classes using the `UriPattern` system from
[`fredemmott/hack-router`](https://github.com/fredemmott/hack-router)

This currently supports generating:
 - Request routing maps
 - Hack request routing classes for your site

 For now, looking at the unit tests is the best way to learn how to use
 it.
